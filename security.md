#gulp-source-scanner security

If you find or suspect you have found a security problem with this package, please report it to me via email at `neil [dot] craig [at] thedotproduct.org`. This will allow me time to assess the threat and create an update to solve it without disclosing the issue to potentially malicious 3rd parties. Security is always my top priority and thus I will attend to any issues as quickly as possible.

If you find a vulnerability in a required package, you're welcome to notify me though unless it's one of my packages, I may not be able to fix the issue (though I may opt to move away from that package).

##NSP
I will always aim (and will automate this soon) to test required packages via [NSP](https://github.com/nodesecurity/nsp) prior to publishing.
